# Cifar10_image_classification_Keras

Cifar10 Image Classification with Keras (2.0.6).


A CNN architecture with several Conv and Core layers. It was, also, used Cyclic Learning Rate Technique (CLR) to force model to converge faster and easier to an optimal minima. 


CLR and Batch Normalisation improved the time of training epochs from 2500sec to ~1300sec (sic) per epoch.
